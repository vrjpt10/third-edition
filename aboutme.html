							<p>Hello there!</p>
							<p>Welcome to my personal website! I’m Vaishnavi Rajput, and I’m delighted to have you here. I recently completed my <b>Master of Science in Computer Engineering</b> from <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/"><b>New York University</b></a>, and I’m excited to embark on the next chapter of my journey.</p>
							<p>Currently, I am interning at <a href="https://www.blockconvey.com/"><b>Block Convey</b></a> as a <b>Development Data Analyst</b>, where I am gaining valuable experience and further expanding my skills in the field of data science and analysis. This internship opportunity has allowed me to work on cutting-edge projects and collaborate with a team of talented professionals.</p>
							<p>Throughout my academic and professional experiences, I have developed a strong passion for machine learning, data science and its potential to create positive change. I have had the privilege of working on diverse projects and collaborating with amazing organizations that have shaped my skills and expertise in the field. One of my recent experiences was at <a href="https://cds.nyu.edu/"><b>NYU Centre of Data Science</b></a> where I developed a <a href="https://github.com/nyu-big-data/final-project-group-29">music recommendation system</a> under the guidance of <a href="https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/brian-mcfee">Professor Brian McFee</a> and Professor <a href="https://as.nyu.edu/faculty/pascal-wallisch.html">Pascal Wallisch</a>. This model was pretty accurate, with a 7% loss rate in predicting song recommendation for listeners. It was amazing to see how data insights could be used to create personalized playlist. To know more about this, and my other projects, check out my <a href="https://github.com/vrjpt10">github</a>.</p>
							<p>Before that, I worked as a SEO Intern and then <b>Software Engineer</b> at <b>YM Grad</b> in India. I was involved in implementing effective search engine optimization strategies that resulted in a 200% increase in organic traffic for their website. Moreover, I had the chance to contribute to the development of a tailored school and program recommendation system, which significantly improved acceptance rates for students.</p>
							<p>One of the highlights of my journey was my role as <b>Club Vice President</b> and <b>Editorial Head</b> at JSSATE (my undergrad college) in India, where I collaborated with students in organizing technical events. Additionally, I published two department newsletter to share the latest advancements in electrical engineering, fostering knowledge exchange among peers and faculty members.</p>
							<p>But it doesn’t stop there! In addition to my technical experiences, I also contributed to the community as a part of the NGO <a href="https://www.lightdeliteracy.com/">“Light de Literacy”</a>. Through this organization, I dedicated my time to teaching underprivileged children from nearby areas, helping them gain access to education and opportunities for a brighter future. It was a truly rewarding experience to be able to make a positive impact on their lives and witness their growth and enthusiasm for learning.</p>
							<p>In conclusion, I am thrilled to be sharing my journey with you. I am grateful for the opportunities I have had to work on impactful projects, collaborate with talented individuals, and contribute to the community. As I step into the next phase of my career, I am excited to bring my skills, passion, and dedication to a full-time role where I can continue to make a positive impact. I am eager to join a team that values innovation, collaboration, and data-driven decision-making.</p>
							<p>Please feel free to explore my website further to learn more about my projects, skills, and accomplishments. If you are interested in connecting or have any opportunities to discuss, I would be thrilled to hear from you. Together, let’s embark on a journey of discovery and make a difference in the world through the power of technology.</p>
							<p>Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope to connect with you soon!</p>
							<p>Best regards,</p>
							<p>Vaishnavi Rajput</p>
